# Simple Artificial Neural Networks

This repo contains an example of an artificial neural network that predicts whether or not a bank customer will leave or stay with the bank over the next 6 months based on 12 variables. 

These follow along with a deep learning course I am taking. 

You will need the following:
- Python
- an IDE (I recommend Spyder3, as part of Anaconda)
- Theano
- TensorFlow
- Keras

You can learn more about [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/) and find download instructions [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download). If you install Anaconda, it will come with a majority of the packages you need.

To install Theano
``` 
pip install theano
```

To install TensorFlow
```
pip install tensorflow
```

To install Keras
```
pip install keras
```

If you have installed Anaconda you should perform an update by:
```
conda update --all
```
